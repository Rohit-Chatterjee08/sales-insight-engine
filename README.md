ü§ñ AI Insights Engine: Autonomous FMCG Data Analysis Dashboard
The AI Insights Engine is a sophisticated, web-based dashboard that transforms raw data files (CSV, Excel, JSON) into interactive visualizations and detailed narrative reports. Powered by a crew of autonomous AI agents using Mistral and CrewAI, this application provides a "Power BI-style" experience, allowing non-technical users to gain deep insights from complex datasets with a single click.

This project was built to demonstrate a production-grade, resilient architecture for agentic AI applications, incorporating advanced error handling, caching, and a user-friendly interface.

‚ú® Key Features
Multi-Format Data Upload: Seamlessly handles .csv, .xlsx, and .json files.

Autonomous AI Analysis: A multi-agent system that intelligently performs a complete analysis pipeline:

AI Feature Selection: Automatically identifies the most relevant columns for analysis.

AI Data Classification: Determines which columns are numerical and which are categorical.

Code-Based Aggregation: Uses pandas for reliable, high-performance data aggregation.

Deterministic Visuals: Generates dashboard data using robust Python code, eliminating AI unpredictability.

AI-Powered Reporting: A specialized agent writes a detailed, narrative summary based on the final data.

Interactive Dashboard: Dynamically generates KPI cards, bar charts, and pie charts using Chart.js.

Detailed Analysis Tab: Provides a full, well-formatted text report generated by the Senior Business Analyst agent.

Robust & Resilient: Built with production-grade error handling, including:

Retry with Exponential Backoff for all API calls to handle rate limiting.

Data Sanitization to process messy, real-world data without crashing.

Graceful Degradation to ensure the user always gets a useful output, even if a non-critical step fails.

Smart Caching: Implements a filesystem cache to instantly serve results for previously analyzed files, saving time and API costs.
